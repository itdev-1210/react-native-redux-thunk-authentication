# Redux + Redux Persist + Thunk + Router Flux Example 

This project template was built with [react-native init](https://github.com/facebook/react-native).

## Important Note:
To use the example, u need a server with some route like **http://192..168.0.115:8080/api/user**  
The route fetchs users in database and return if user exists, to login function in react-native app  

## How to use?

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to repo folder
3. run **npm install**
4. open project in some IDE
5. open file **src/actions/Login.js** and change the route defined in const **login** function. (actual route is http://192.168.0.115:8080/api/user)
6. run your emulation device (in my case, i used a pluged device)
7. run **react-native run-android** (or react-native run-ios)
